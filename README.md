### What I learned

This was one of the first projects that I created using javascript. Getting the validation working on the contact form was the biggest challenge for this project. I opted to go with Jquery at the time because that was what I was studying. I'll eventually overhaul this project and use vanilla javascript, as I think I will be able to re-code this without having to call an additional outside library.

I also used multiple addClass/removeClass functions for creating the accordion effect on the FAQ section. This taught me that it's hard to chain these together but still keep the code D.R.Y.



### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap v4 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) - Bootstrap has been updated to version 5 in the time since I created this landing page. But I heavily used these 4.6 documents while creating this project.
- 
- [jQuery API Docs](https://api.jquery.com/) - The standard reference for quickly looking up $jquery methods.
